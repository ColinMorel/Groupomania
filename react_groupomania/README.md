# Getting Started

First go to the Groupomania_Back repo, and proceed to install the backend environment and the database.

# Install the server

Go into the terminal, and change the directory if needed, to make sure you're in the Groupomania_front/react_groupomania folder.
Then write `npm install`.
After that, write `npm start` to start your local server. If it succeeded, a http://localhost:3000 browser window should oppened. That's the front server.
